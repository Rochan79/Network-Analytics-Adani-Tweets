Adani is a big name not only in India but also globally. It’s been about three weeks since Hindenburg, a New York-based short-selling firm, accused Adani Group of “pulling the largest con in corporate history” through stock manipulation, and accounting fraud. In response to Hindenburg’s allegations, Adani Group issued a 413-page reply calling the short-sellers claims “stale, baseless, and discredited allegations.” This spiked a sort-of political debate in the country and people started questioning whether the political leaders in power had something to do with these Adani scams. We started witnessing a ton of twitter riots, the obvious memes, and also the propagation of speculated information that lacks evidence.

The allegations have nevertheless had an immediate knock-on effect, with more than $100 billion wiped from the group’s market value, as well as Gautam Adani losing his status as both Asia and India’s richest man. With the context set, now we proceed to the analysis.
